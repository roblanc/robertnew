title: "Practice digital reset"

And what I am trying right now is a digital reset.

And no, it is not a digital detox. I am not leaving the Internet. It is a reset.

So, what is a digital reset? How do I view it?

I view it as a clean digital slate.

My aim is to have a fresh YouTube feed.

A fresh email inbox.

And a fresh Netflix feed.

I am going to have a clean browsing history, no 'well-polished' targeted recommendations coming through my feed.

And, in theory, I will be 'free' to choose whatever I want to choose to consume.

And I know that I am still going to have to face the stuff that's trending and that Big Tech is going to try to shove that in my face.

And that if you really want to go philosophical on this one, start asking questions such as: Are you really free?

But if we go on this path, the discussion is kind of never-ending.

So I choose to do what I can with what I have. And I still believe that this is going to be a cool exercise.

I think that it depends on how deeply embedded some of the things you consume are within yourself.

So once you'll face a fresh feed and will and probably you won't want to click on anything, you will start searching for something  you know interests you.

And then it is about reflecting whether or not you are really interested in that particular topic.

And by the way, this type of reset can work in your personal life as well.
