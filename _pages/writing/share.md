title: "Share the obvious"
---

We are all constantly surrounded and exposed to a range of products, services and experiences. But how often to do we actually take the time to share the obvious, and let other people know what has made us so happy or successful?
Everybody’s ideas seem obvious to them. Maybe what’s obvious to me is amazing to someone else?

The power of sharing is often overlooked and underestimated. When we share what works for us, we are not only exposing those around us to something they may be interested in, but we are also giving back to the community in a way that can impact many people.

Sharing has the power to spread joy, knowledge, and opportunity. It can spark a discussion and show that we are all connected by common experiences and products. It can bring attention to something we love but don’t necessarily think of as “newsworthy” or exciting.

When we share the obvious, we are also helping others avoid mistakes, save money, and discover new things. We can show the world, through our own experiences, what works and what doesn’t.

By sharing the obvious, we are all doing our part to make the world a better place. We are providing invaluable information that can help someone, whether it’s about a product, service or experience.

So, take a moment and think about what you have experienced and enjoyed recently. Namely, have you found something that has made your life a bit simpler, more productive, or more enjoyable? If so, then consider sharing it with others. Your own experience could be the perfect story or resource for someone else.

Share the obvious, and you will be part of a movement that will bring positivity, understanding and growth to the world.
