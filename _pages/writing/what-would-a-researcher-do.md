At times, I find myself enveloped in a fog of bewilderment, a sinister shadow born of subconscious fears obscuring my clarity of thought. It feels as though I've strayed from my own path of creation, losing sight of that inner zeal, that inner smile that once guided me.

In such moments, I ponder, "What would a (remarkably efficient) researcher do in my shoes?" Embracing this mindset could illuminate the way forward. My desire to delve into the vastness of computing, coupled with my eagerness to craft things of value—things that resonate with and are enjoyed by others—remains undiminished.

Remember, a researcher doesn't always chase a fully-formed goal. It's a dance of hypotheses and methodologies. The key is to cultivate a process that brings joy and satisfies your curiosity. As this process evolves, so too will your journey towards achieving your aspirations, in due course.
